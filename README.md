# Hi, I'm Wassim 

I'm a software engineer who has always been obsorbed by code, always been passionate about technology and helping others. Been fiddling with code since early web days and developed application using amazing technologies such as .net/.net core, angular and GraphQL. Recently I got so interested in home automation and been busy building my own smart home.
